Starting from the smallest, they are: {Minicompact Cars, Subcompact Cars, Compact Cars, Midsize Cars, and Large Cars}. The vehicle classes can be found in the 'VClass' variable, while the engine sizes are in the 'displ' column (in liters). **Hint**: Make sure that the order of vehicle classes makes sense in your plot!"

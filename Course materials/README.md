# AIPND
This repository contains code and associated files for the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. This repository consists of a number of tutorial notebooks for various coding exercises and programming labs that will be used to supplement the lessons of the course.

## Table Of Contents

### Tutorial Notebooks
* Linear Algebra Essentials
    * [Vectors Lab](https://github.com/udacity/AIPND/tree/master/linearalgebra-vectors_lab "Vectors Lab") Learn how to graph 2D vectors.
    * [Linear Combination Lab](https://github.com/udacity/AIPND/tree/master/linearalgebra-linear_combination "Linear Combination Lab") Learn how to computationally determine a vector's span and solve a simple system of equations.
    * [Linear Mapping](https://github.com/udacity/AIPND/tree/master/linearalgebra-linear_mapping "Linear Mapping Labs") Learn how to solve some problems computationally using vectors and matrices.
### Programming Labs
* [Intro to Python Lab - Classifying Images Lab:](https://github.com/udacity/AIPND/tree/master/intropylab-classifying-images "Classifying Images Lab") Determine which CNN architecture model works best at classifying images of dogs and their breeds.

### NumPy and Pandas Mini-Projects
* [NumPy Mini-Project](https://github.com/udacity/AIPND/tree/master/NumPy%20Mini-Project) Mean normalize and separate data
* [Pandas Mini-Project](https://github.com/udacity/AIPND/tree/master/Pandas%20Mini-Project) Get statistics from stock data

### Matplotlib
* [Matplotlib](https://github.com/udacity/AIPND/tree/master/Matplotlib) Notebooks containing practice exercises for the Matplotlib lesson(s)

### Quiz Notes
* [Notes:](https://github.com/udacity/AIPND/tree/master/notes "Notes") This directory contains more information about certain quizzes that are testing more challenging concepts. The filename indicates which _quiz_ the note is covering. Additionally, one will find the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/udacity/AIPND/blob/master/notes/lab_intro-to-python-lab.md) for the _Intro to Python Lab_. Click on the filename to view the contents of the notes on a _quiz_ or the _Intro to Python Lab_.

## Dependencies

Each directory has a `requirements.txt` describing the minimal dependencies required to run the notebooks in that directory.

### pip

To install these dependencies with pip, you can issue `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
